# Croquet Microverse Tutorial 1

[https://croquet.io](https://croquet.io)

A number of demo worlds are included with the Microverse repository. We will use these to demonstrate how to create worlds, cards and behaviors. The first world we will visit is tutorial1.js. You can try this world out immediately once you have installed the repository and run npm start. The launch URL is:

[http://localhost:9684/?world=tutorial1](http://localhost:9684/?world=tutorial1)

It looks like this:

As you can see, this world is shared with another user. tutorial1 is made up of just three cards (not including the avatars). There is a floor card, which allows us to walk around, a light card that lets us see the world around us, and a flat card with the Croquet logo on it. The code defining this world can be found in the worlds folder in the repository. Open microverse/worlds/tutorial.js to see the following code. The init function is used to define the objects that make up the world.

The first value is Constants.AvatarNames, which specifies the name of the 3D model files in microverse/assets/avatars folder. When you add your own avatars, you can simply place them in the same folder and specify their names here.

**Avatars are still under construction and will evolve rapidly as we move toward the Microverse Beta release.**

```Javascript

export function init(Constants) {
    Constants.AvatarNames = [
        "newwhite", "fixmadhatter", "marchhare", "queenofhearts", "cheshirecat", "alice"
    ];
```
The next section defines the various behaviors we will be attaching to our cards. Typically you create a directory for your behavior modules for the world you are creating, and list them in this section.

```Javascript
    Constants.UserBehaviorDirectory = "behaviors/tutorial";
    Constants.UserBehaviorModules = [
        "lights.js", "gridFloor.js"
    ];
```

The final section is where we define the cards. A card is easily defined by a number of parameters including the name, type, where it is first loaded into the world, and how it will be used. Perhaps most important is we can associate a behavior to the card here. A behavior can define how a card is constructed, or how it acts when a user interacts with it, or how it can access live external data streams. Here, the first card, the "world model" is defined by the "GridFloor" module. We will take a look at that shortly. The next card defines the lighting in this world. It is a bit more sophisticated, but is relatively easy to use. The last card creates a much more card-like object. A floating object in the middle of the scene with the Croquet logo applied.

```Javascript
    Constants.DefaultCards = [
        {
            card: {
                name: "world model",
                behaviorModules: ["GridFloor"],
                layers: ["walk"],
                type: "object",
                translation: [0, -1.7, 0],
                shadow: true,
            }
        },
        {
            card: {
                name: "light",
                layers: ["light"],
                type: "lighting",
                behaviorModules: ["Light"],
                clearColor: 0xaabbff,
            }
        },
        {
            card: {
                name: "image card",
                translation: [0, 0.4, -10],
                scale: [4, 4, 4],
                type: "2d",
                textureType: "image",
                textureLocation: "./assets/images/CroquetLogo_RGB.jpg",
                frameColor: 0xcccccc,
                color: 0xffffff,
                cornerRadius: 0.05,
                depth: 0.05,
                shadow: true,
            }
        },
    ];
}
```

Let's explore the properties that are used to define the cards.

`name:` This is used to identify the card within the world and can be any string.

`behaviorModules:`  This is a list of the behaviors that will be applied to a card.

`layers:`  An array that specifies how the card will be used. Here we have one card defined as 'walk', one as 'light' and one as 'pointer'. If you wished to have a card that you could both walk on and interact with you simply specify:

`layers: ['walk', 'pointer']`

`translation: [0, -0.75, -10]` A three element array that specifies the location of the card in the world. These values are in meters. The first element is the x-coordinate, in this case it is 0 so it is in the same x-location as the avatar when it starts. The next is the y-coordinate, which indicates its height above 0. Croquet sets 0 to be the location of the avatar's camera or eye height, so -0.75 places the center of teh card at -0.75 meters beneath the eye point. The last is the z-coordinate which for Croquet and WebGL is defined as a negative value when looking into the screen. Thus, -10 will place the card 10 meters away in front of the avatar.

`scale: [4,4,4]` A three element array that defines how a card will be scaled. Cards are usually imported or defined to be contained within a 1x1x1 box for easier management.

`type: 'object'` This defines the nature of the card. Some cards are 2D objects, some 3D and there are a number of others.

`shadow: true` Specifies that this card will be both a recipient and a caster of shadows in the world. [note: we will want to separate recipient and caster into separate flags].

A full list of card properties will be available at the end of this document.

## Behaviors
---
Now let's take a look at the simple behavior we use to define the floor we are walking around on. This is the "GridFloor" behavior and is defined in the file:

"microverse/behaviors/tutorial/gridFloor.js".

This is the code:

```javascript
// Grid Floor
// Croquet Microverse
// Generates a simple gridded floor card

class GridFloorActor {
    setup() {
        // nothing to do here yet
    }
}

class GridFloorPawn {
    setup() {
        console.log("AM I GETTING HERE?")
        const THREE = Worldcore.THREE;
        const gridImage = './assets/images/grid.png';
        const texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(gridImage);
        texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
        texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
        texture.repeat.set( 100, 100 );

        this.floor = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry( 100, 0.1, 100, 1, 1, 1 ),
            new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture, color: 0xcccccc }));
        this.floor.receiveShadow = true;
        this.shape.add(this.floor);
        this.cleanupColliderObject()
        if (this.actor.layers && this.actor.layers.includes("walk")) {
            this.constructCollider(this.floor);
        }
    }
}

export default {
    modules: [
        {
            name: "GridFloor",
            actorBehaviors: [GridFloorActor],
            pawnBehaviors: [GridFloorPawn],
        }
    ]
}
```

It is a very simple behavior. The major part of the system is to construct the 3D floor and apply a grid to it. You may recognize that it uses the Three.js 3D rendering system.

There are three parts to this behavior. The first is what we call the "actor". In Croquet, the actor is the replicated state of the object - the part that Croquet guarantees is exactly the same on every users machines at all times. In this case, the GridFloorActor doesn't have much to do to keep things in sync and is really just a placeholder.

The second part is what we call the "pawn". As might be clear from its name, it is controlled by the actor and it's job is to represent the state of the actor as the actor is updated - whether from the local user or a remote user. In this case, the only job of the GridFloorPawn is to construct something for us to stand on. As you can see, the floor is simply a three.js BoxGeometry with a grid texture applied to it.

The last part of the behavior code is simply bundling the actor and pawn behaviors into an exportable module that can then be added to the card when we create that.
